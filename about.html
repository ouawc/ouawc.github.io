    The Association of Women in Computing is a student organization at the University of Oklahoma. We act to provide a community space for women in technological fields that may otherwise feel overwhelmed in a male-dominated sector of society. By doing this, we will raise awareness about gender inequality in the workforce, and we hope to recruit male allies as our organization grows. We have weekly study groups, monthly general meetings, and frequent company visits and tech talks.

    The mission of the Association of Women in Computing student group is to create a community for women in technological fields at the University of Oklahoma. We teach and encourage our members to be confident in their abilities despite the social stigma surrounding women in computing.
